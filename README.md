## Infrastructure should be understandable.

Modern infrastructure is spread across dozens of tools.

Docker.
Proxmox.
Kubernetes.
Home Assistant.
SSH.
Cloud providers.
Dashboards.

Atlas brings them together into a single platform that understands your infrastructure before it changes it.

Instead of asking:

> "What command do I run?"

Atlas helps answer:

> **"What is happening, what should I do next, and why?"**

# What is Atlas?

Atlas is an open-source conversational infrastructure platform.

It analyzes infrastructure, explains deployments, identifies risks, recommends actions, and eventually executes approved changes through a unified operational experience.

Atlas is designed for:

- Homelabs
- Self-hosted services
- Edge infrastructure
- Small business environments
- Enterprise platforms

---

# Philosophy

Atlas follows one simple rule.

> **Understanding comes before automation.**

Every deployment follows the same workflow.

```text
Understand

↓

Explain

↓

Recommend

↓

Approve

↓

Execute

↓

Observe
```

Automation without understanding creates surprises.

Atlas is designed to eliminate those surprises.
